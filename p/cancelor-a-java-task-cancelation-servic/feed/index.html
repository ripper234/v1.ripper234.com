		<description><![CDATA[Fair enough. Alright, one more question: How would you use this if you&#039;re not starting the thread directly but rather using an ExecutorService? You only get a Future back, I don&#039;t believe you have direct access to the thread. I haven&#039;t look at the code of Future yet, but you could probably extend Future to support this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s IoC got to do with it? You can always inject an &quot;ICancellationService&quot; and expose the threadlocal as a getToken() method call or whatever.

		<description><![CDATA[Tomer, a boolean or AtomicBoolean is indeed the second other solution I discussed. The one downside is that sometimes you need to pass this boolean along a few call chains, which doesn&#039;t play nice with IOC frameworks like Guice. It is true however that it&#039;s a KISS solution that just works.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Instead of using a string value and searching a global hashmap (potentially inefficient), there are several things you can do:

* Ideally you&#039;d use a volatile bool for this (since there&#039;s only one state change -- cancelled: false-&#062;true). I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s possible to pass such a variable byref to child threads, so you&#039;ll probably need a reference type in there anyway.
* Since that&#039;s the case, you may want to use a single flag variable (AtomicBoolean), place it in an InheritableThreadLocal (http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/InheritableThreadLocal.html) and expose it once when the primary task is constructed. This allows you to cancel the entire task tree with a single boolean write. I&#039;m not sure how well this performs, but it does seem like an elegant solution to the problem and possibly worth investigating. There may also be issues when using a scheduler (since all tasks share a common thread pool) but I suppose there are ways around that as well.]]></description>
