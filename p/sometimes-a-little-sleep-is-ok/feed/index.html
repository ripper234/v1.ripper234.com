		<description><![CDATA[@sun - Nice use case.

When you&#039;re writing web crawlers, often you should be mindful of your resources, and since sleep() wastes a thread, you might want to look at other solutions like async-IO.

Still, I agree that if resources on your own crawler are not an issue, a quick-and-dirty sleep() on the crawler threads might be the best solution. Your comment takes me back a bit to my days of writing web crawlers at Delver 1.0. (We were a &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2008/01/28/delver-comes-out-of-stealth-with-a-new-twist-on-social-search/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;social search engine&lt;/a&gt; once)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One thing I&#039;ve learned is that its OK to be religious about different aspects of software development, but being fanatic is usually counter-productive. Even in &quot;AntiPatterns&quot;, the author wisely specifies exceptions - cases where an AntiPattern might be acceptable. That includes Gotos, DoEvents/ProcessMessages, Waits/Sleeps... don&#039;t judge a tool by its misuse.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The whole page is supposed to close and move to the next one when the callback finishes.
No point in making just the &quot;loading&quot; icon fade out, if the entire page changes or closes.

Also, the loading gif is animated in the first place, adding a second dynamic effect like fading it out isn&#039;t good in my subjective opinion.

I&#039;m arguing that the delay does not deter from the user experience, but rather makes it smoother and more consistent.

From the comments here, and on Facebook and G+, it looks like I&#039;m in the minority.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So your solution for &quot;it happens too fast and my long-loading icon is flickering&quot; is to artificially make it slower? Wouldn&#039;t it be better to just address the flickering, by e.g. showing the spinner only after a certain time or fading it in/out so it doesn&#039;t flicker? You&#039;re literally saying &quot;dear user, this could&#039;ve been instantaneous but for your convenience I&#039;ve made it take longer so you could appreciate my nice spinner&quot;. I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a very good idea.]]></description>
