		<description><![CDATA[@Eli, I measured how long the test takes to run. While I forgot to attach the test code here, it basically spun a few concurrent reader/writer threads that all had contention on a single lock. They did a very small amount of work inside that lock, then gave it up. If I remember correctly, I had a fixed ratio of readers vs writers. Increasing the number of threads in this case increases the runtime because there is actually more work to do.

In this case I simply wanted to see how well the lock performs under extreme contention. It is not &quot;realistic&quot; - you&#039;d need to think more thoroughly about what exactly you&#039;re trying to measure to get more meaningful results - but even this simplistic testing was interesting in that it exposes differences between the different implementations.

Looking forward to your post on RW locks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ron,

Nice writeup - I recently looked into RW locks, recalled that you once wrote about it and came back to read it. I&#039;m not sure I understand your performance graph - what are you measuring exactly? Also, are you really creating that many threads - and if so, is it really realistic, or would a better benchmark involve a realistic amount of threads with a vertical load (i.e. large amount of read and write operations to perform)?]]></description>
