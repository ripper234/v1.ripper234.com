		<description><![CDATA[E-mail notification just notified me of the new post, but also of many old ones.
I hope next time it will only notify me about the latest post.

Hiromi is great, she was in Israel a few times (though I didn&#039;t get to see her shows) and her track Summer Rain is one of the best things you&#039;ll ever hear (although  it&#039;s different from most of her other things and in a different style - hope she played it for you).]]></description>
