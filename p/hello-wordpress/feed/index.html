		<description><![CDATA[The list of plugins currently enabled on my blog are:

* All in One SEO Pack
* Alter Feed Links
* Clean Archives Reloaded
* Google Analyticator
* Google XML Sitemaps
* Lighter Menus
* Live Comment Preview
* Post-Plugin Library
* Redirection
* Similar Posts
* Simple Tags
* Subscribe To Comments
* Wordpress Automatic Upgrade
* WordPress Database Backup
* WP-OpenID
* WP-Syntax
* WP Ajax Edit Comments
* WP Super Cache

I&#039;m not sure all of them currently work 100% correctly (I tried WP Ajax Edit Comments and it didn&#039;t work for some reason). I installed my wordpress on my own machine at first, and it worked, but for some reason it stopped working when I uploaded the blog to GoDaddy. Also, I have currently disabled Super Cache, it may only be relevant to very high load blogs and I don&#039;t think my qualifies :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good luck !
As long as you don&#039;t have to customize it, Wordpress is really great. Customizing it means digging in PHP code which makes you want to retch :-) 
But customization is rarely needed, as you can have anything done with plugins.

BTW, I really like your comment preview plugin. Which one is it ?]]></description>
