		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, you&#039;re not the first one to tell me I picked the wrong example to go on a crusade for. After all, there&#039;s nothing holy about spreading naked pictures...

The point that I&#039;m trying to make is that I want to have an internet where even things that aren&#039;t &quot;good&quot; or &quot;moral&quot; have a place. I do not want a centralized authority picking what&#039;s right. I want a place for communities can form to discuss what interests them without being policed.

The topic of discussion here isn&#039;t the specific content ... but rather the general principle of freedom from censorship even when it&#039;s inconvenient or illegal (breaking the law isn&#039;t bad by definition, as long as you&#039;re willing to pay the price).

I&#039;m not trying to convince you that we should support this model. I am not claiming this is a universal truth. I am saying that I personally prefer a world with uncensorable information, to a police state. Right now we are somewhere in between ... thankfully, I personally don&#039;t live in a police state (some would argue this), but &lt;a href=&#039;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China&#039; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; do.

In China it is &quot;immoral&quot; to view porn, access social networks, speak against the government ... and I support technologies that enable that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really, Ron? I usually enjoy your writing a lot. Don&#039;t always concur. but don&#039;t object either. Free speech, hey?! 
But this time I beg to differ. The fact that the heavyweights have deep pockets and drones of lawyers to protect them, while a miserable trusting girl who&#039;s boyfriend got back at by posting her picture, or a poor soul whom some sicko found attractive enough to snap a picture of in the morgue (WTF?) don&#039;t, is sad. But to come to the conclusion that anarchy is the solution?  If my daughter&#039;s picture were splattered all over the web and she&#039;d feel her life is ruined I&#039;d sure as hell want someone I could appeal to, or sue, or at least shame to hell. The fact that the stars couldn&#039;t do it either wouldn&#039;t console me one bit. If she were depressed, I&#039;d sure as hell want it legally enforceable to prevent anyone from giving her advice on how to end it all. And don&#039;t even get me started about websites for building weapons of mass destruction in the current affair of things. 
The world is filled with sick people with substandard morals who&#039;ll post anything no matter who it hurts. Calling that free speech is ridiculous. The system we&#039;ve got is seriously flawed I&#039;ll grant you that, but the wild west where everyone just took what they wanted sure as hell wasn&#039;t better. The fact that we can go back there doesn&#039;t necessarily mean we should.]]></description>
