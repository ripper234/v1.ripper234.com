		<description><![CDATA[Well I guess it depends on the definition. I would &lt;i&gt;define&lt;/i&gt; a game as &quot;solved&quot; if the solution gives the optimal strategy at any given game state. On probabilistic games this does not guarantee victory, but it does &lt;b&gt;guarantee&lt;/b&gt; the best chance of victory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Optimal strategy - yes.&lt;br/&gt;Solution - no.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is usually implied by solution is a strategy that *guarantees* some result. An optimal strategy in a probabilistic game can perhaps guarantee an average result over many games, but not a result in a single game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t agree. Even probabilistic games (as long as they&#039;re Perfect Information) can have an optimal strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One could theoretically construct a database with &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; possible backgammon games and deduce the chances of winning from every position - and so come with the best strategy. I think the problem is this database would be extremely large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games that may not have a winning strategy are those with some hidden information - Prisoner&#039;s Dilemma and Poker come to mind.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right of course, this is the result of writing a post in 5 seconds without thinking :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now that I think about it, I doubt Shesh-Besh (Backgammon) could actualy be solved so easily - it&#039;s randomized, which adds another dimension of complexity to it all. It&#039;s still a sucky game though, and I enjoy Checkers more as it&#039;s less dependant on luck. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I know some players adhere to the view that backgammon is a game of skill, but to me it always looked like an &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%A1&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ars &lt;/a&gt; game.]]></description>
