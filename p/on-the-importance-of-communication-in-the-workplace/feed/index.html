		<description><![CDATA[It depends on who you are, what your preferences are and what you&#039;re working on. Not everyone works on a giant software project, and it&#039;s entirely possible to create impressive software with only 1-2 people who don&#039;t communicate all that well.

Good communication skills are always nice, but IMO the objective need for good communication skills is a function of team size (the bigger the team, the more crucial good communication is to the success of the project) and scope of responsibility (senior developers have to communicate with other professionals significantly more than junior developers; system architects even more so; managers fundamentally need better communication skills). If you choose to stay in the trenches you can get away with crappy communication skills even in the largest of organizations.

By the way, quality of communication is orthogonal to friendliness; you can be the biggest asshole in the world and still get your point across, or you can be the friendliest guy in the world and simply fail to be understood.]]></description>
