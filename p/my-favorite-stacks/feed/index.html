		<description><![CDATA[Dear Bubba: the &#039;stack&#039; topic-centric platform... sucks. Buncha lame fuquers too lazy to Google for a quick answer, set to eventually receive misinformed responses from jaw-flapping &#039;wannabe esperts&#039;.

You call that a plan?

The platform doesn&#039;t stand as &#039;site&#039;. It&#039;s an awkward proposition to web 2-point-oh bolt it onto an existing community site. Poor reader wanders through and clicks 

http://meta.stackexchange.com/revisions/5/list

WTF? a &#039;community wiki&#039; answer format? So reader has the joy of reading blather, like &quot;Sammy added 7 characters&quot; and &quot;anomalous deleted whatever on date suchandsuch&quot;. Bye now]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey ripper.  I&#039;m glad you got Draw3Cards up.  I&#039;m now an active member!  I emailed the guys at Monday Night Magic and asked them to plug the site, so hopefully, when they do, more people will start coming into the community.  I&#039;m telling friends as well.  Such an awesome idea!  If you hadn&#039;t done it, I would have.  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, I have a Nexus One - I said it to the group last time we met, but I guess my comment was swallowed by the noise of the caffe. I don&#039;t know if N1 is the best choice (haven&#039;t really done a detailed comparison), but I&#039;m &lt;a href=&quot;http://demo.delver.com/htc-google-nexus-one-phone-3g-quad-band-unlocked/21810656/reviews/970&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;enjoying the phone very much&lt;/a&gt;, and Android is great. 

Too bad Mathoverflow limit themselves to higher math - there should be such a resource for &#039;humble 1st degree math students&#039;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ron, do you have an Android phone? If so, which one?

Re Mathoverflow, isn&#039;t it kinda scary? I&#039;m been listening to the SO podcast recently and Jeff and Joel laugh about it all the time :-)]]></description>
