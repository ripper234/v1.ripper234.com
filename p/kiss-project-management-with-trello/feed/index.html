		<description><![CDATA[@sun - Redmine seems to be some variant on the &quot;standard&quot; issue tracker.
While these have their place, what I really like about Trello is its slickness, which I haven&#039;t seen in a lot of competing products.
If so easy to create an &quot;issue&quot; (a card, really) in Trello, that you don&#039;t think twice about it.

The downside is that it still does&#039;t have a lot of the features we&#039;re used to from traditional issue trackers (e.g. even its search seems sub-optimal right now ... but they&#039;re working on it).

Did you give Trello a shot? Trying playing with it for 10 minutes, you get the feeling of the product pretty fast.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh wow, Trello is sweet! And I simply augmented my Google account with it, didn&#039;t even need to create a new username + password combo.

For one collaborative project across continents, I&#039;ve had the chance to use Basecamp (see basecamphq.com), which isn&#039;t free. One of the collaborators got us a basecamp project under the courtesy of his employer. It is quite intuitive, yet leaves much room for customization, and does not force you into a specific pattern of work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@doron - thanks for sharing. I tried Pivotal a little bit, and rather liked it as well.

It certainly contains more features about estimating and predicting features size / project velocity. There are a few quirks there that take some time getting used to, but it&#039;s a great tool - I&#039;m not saying Trello &gt;&gt; Pivotal.

I do believe however that Trello is easier to use for people who aren&#039;t familiar with Agile/Scrumm and Poker Planning methods. It took me a while to explain Pivotal to my team at Google, and I could see that the concepts weren&#039;t sinking in with some of them. Pivotal really is more powerful ... but if you don&#039;t care about medium-long term planning, and are mainly concerned about what you&#039;ll be doing in the next few weeks - Trello is simple and gets the job done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I use pivotal tracker. also in an &quot;Unnamed Hot New Startup I Recently Joined&quot;.
The main difference I think is that in pivotal you need to set a velocity for the team (and after a while pivotal will learn your real velocity).
This way pivotal can help you figure when features will be done, and will not allow you to over-work your team.]]></description>
