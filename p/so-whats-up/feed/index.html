		<description><![CDATA[I recommend making a priority out of properly diagonizing the bipolar disorder, for the simple reason that it&#039;s treatable with medication. It&#039;s not perfect but it can certainly help with the reduced productivity during depression, and taking on unsustainable commitments during hypomania, resulting in an overall better ability to achieve your goals and happiness. Possibly, more so than any cognitive reflection you can do.

Also, there&#039;s a science to being happy. Learning this science could prove more useful than simply thinking about how to steer your life into happiness. I recommend the following post by the brilliant Luke Muehlhauser - http://lesswrong.com/lw/4su/how_to_be_happy/.

The following excerpt says it all:
&quot;I was unhappy for most of my life and even considered suicide a few times. Then I spent two years studying the science of happiness. Now, happiness is my natural state. I can&#039;t remember the last time I felt unhappy for longer than 20 minutes.&quot;

Relatedly, I&#039;m sure you know your fair share of productivity hacks, but studying more could help. LessWrong is full of discussions about these, which could prove useful in mitigating the effects of depression; e.g., http://lesswrong.com/lw/3w3/how_to_beat_procrastination/.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It was a very interesting read. I think that writing about all the things that happened in your life lately could help to refocus and find patterns that are helpful or harmful.

I hope you will be better soon, and go kick some butt with your ninja skills!]]></description>
