		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always hated assembly. For me, it&#039;s always some other people had to do, but my best qualities are in the domain of more abstract programming languages. I would have definitely failed that test :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What I love about programming is that it&#039;s enough to do something once. If you do it once, you box it up and can reuse it however you want. The more advanced programming languages we have today keep inventing new ways to reuse code, which is great for a lazy person like me (I think laziness is a desired quality in a programmer).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I was still young and innocent, I was interviewing to Intel as a student (it was the year 2000). They asked me the famous &quot;an ant climbs the stairs - either 1 or 2 at the time, how many ways to reach the Nth step&quot; to which the answer is Fibonacci.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When asked to provide a solution I, naturally, wrote the recursive one in C. For which I was severely punished, because the interviewer slyly grinned and asked me to write it in assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A double recursion in assembly. Now that&#039;s fun ! For me as a 3rd semester student it wasn&#039;t easy, but eventually I guess I managed, because they accepted me (though I went to IBM).]]></description>
