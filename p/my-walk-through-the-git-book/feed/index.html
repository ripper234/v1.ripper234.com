		<description><![CDATA[Re: How does pushing actually work?:
the if your local branch is *tracking* a remote branch, then git-push will work without arguments.
usually when you create a local branch off of a remote one (e.g. &quot;git checkout origin/fa&quot; &#038; &quot;git checkout -b fa&quot;) it will create the new local branch (fa) as a tracking the remote one (origin/fa)

apparently from your example, pushing a local branch to a remote repo, causing a creation of a new branch on the remote, will create the same tracking relationship between the local and remote branch]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re: fast forward:
see my previous comment - this simply means &quot;moving the origin/branch&quot; label forward until it meets &quot;branch&quot; label.  If you think with labels in the gitk view, the whole git model becomes simple to digest]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re: How can you see the ‘branch structure’ of a repository?
your conclusion is correct - git keeps track of objects, not branches.
You should treat branches (and tags) simply as labels, that mark interesting commits.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re: After I git merge without conflicts, is a git commit needed?
you do not need to commit, because git creates a commit representing the merge (does not include any change in files, but is pointing to both parent commits). gitk and see that for yourself.
So you so actually *do* need to Push it to the remote, tracked branch (assuming you have one).]]></description>
