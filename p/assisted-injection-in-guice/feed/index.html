		<description><![CDATA[@Doug - I don&#039;t believe you can do that (at least without ugly hacks like changing the &quot;final&quot; property of the field with reflection). Assisted injection is just a shortcut - if you can&#039;t achieve this via a full-fledged Factory class, then assisted injection won&#039;t help you.

Try asking on Stack Overflow though, there might be something I missed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can you show how to use this assist technique to set a final variable?

As far as I can tell, Guice uses constructors that DO NOT set the final variable (because your build() method will set it). But if your constructor doesn&#039;t set the final variable, the compiler stops you.

How are you getting around not having a constructor set the final variable?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[you only need ... factory ... annotate... tell guice...

sigh

Java is so tiresome even with reasonably good tooling.

.NET frameworks allow stuff like .Resolve(new{numberOfRetries=3}) and really be done with it.  I&#039;d bet that scala would support it]]></description>
