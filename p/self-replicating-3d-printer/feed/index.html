		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, the article really doesn&#039;t reveal much if anything of how this is achieved. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As I said, it still looks like a research project, but you have to admit that in theory the idea is possible. I have not investigated how these 3D printers even work, but beyond &quot;difficult engineering&quot; problems I don&#039;t see why this product can&#039;t exist now or in the near future. The &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://qimmortal.blogspot.com/2008/03/robot-dog.html&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;robot dog&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about before would have surely seem like SciFi 10-15 years ago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While the idea sounds terrific(*), from reading the website it looks like rubbish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastic 3-D &quot;printers&quot; are not a new technology, mechanical engineers are using them to build mock-ups and models for at least a few years, for prices affordable to mechanical shops. &lt;br/&gt;But I&#039;m really curious how these guys intend to &quot;print&quot; the printer&#039;s hardware (especially the integrated circuits) and software, metallic parts, wires, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(*) I&#039;m sure Hofstadter would&#039;ve been ecstatic]]></description>
