		<description><![CDATA[Concurrency 101: think before you do. This applies to correct data structure choices as much as it does concurrency/synchronization layout, trading safety and simplicity for performance and complexity.

		<description><![CDATA[This is exactly my point.

The map is the global object, so it deserves special attention. I would start with a concurrent hashmap for its implementation. Another option is to have several (say 100) maps, each with its own lock - so the contention for each lock is much smaller (you can calculate which map holds which inbox by hashing its ID).

An individual inbox, however, will get almost zero contention - so its implementation can be very naive. The gist here is to think carefully about how much contention each data structure will see, and choose its implementation accordingly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I might be missing something, but you&#039;re performance profiling looks a bit off.
It seems that you&#039;ll always need to call the map (MANY MANY times) to in order to do any operation. It doesn&#039;t really matter if the value of the map is not used that often (thus it might be okay to lock the inbox object), it&#039;s the map that you&#039;re trying to avoid contention on.]]></description>
