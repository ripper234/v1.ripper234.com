		<description><![CDATA[@ken - 

Sometimes getting better is not a realistic option, because your competitors have a huge head start. In this case, I really feel that the market is so crowded that nothing Baraza do here will stand any chance to compete. I could be wrong here, of course - I did say the same thing about three years ago, when Aya suggested I launch a Q&amp;A site. I told her &quot;No need, there&#039;s Yahoo Answers&quot;, and then came Stack Overflow/Exchange and stampeded over everything...

The difference now is that I know exactly how much explosive growth Stack Overflow has shown, and I understand what edge OSQA &amp; Shapado have over it (being FOSS). Quora, also, have some edge, being so integrated with Facebook. There is only room in the world for so many successful Q&amp;A platforms, and seriously, I see nothing innovative about Baraza.

Are you seeing something I&#039;m missing?]]></description>
