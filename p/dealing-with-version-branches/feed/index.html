		<description><![CDATA[Eli:

1. Merge code that 30 people committed from the version branch to trunk can be a daunting task for one person. I prefer delegating and distributing this responsibility to all the devs.
2. I agree - in general, merging quickly also is easier. The longer you wait, the harder it is to merge, because the odds the code has change increase with time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ron, 

This is a real problem and automating parts of the process can&#039;t hurt. However, I remember two simpler solutions from my IBM days:

1. The person responsible for said branch has to make sure (after release) that the branch was merged back, by diffing the branch with the trunk and seeing that all bugs are in. This shouldn&#039;t take too long.
2. When serious bug fixes are made to the release branch, it&#039;s recommended to immediately merge them to trunk. Merging single bug fixes is usually very easy and takes a couple of minutes.]]></description>
