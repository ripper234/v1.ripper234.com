		<description><![CDATA[Just like when you buy a dollar bond, nobody guarantees anything about the value of the dollar itself, just so in bitcoin.
You can buy bitcoin futures at http://bitoption.org

A lot of people are just holding bitcoin in their wallet anyway - so for them the risk tied to bitcoin currency is there anyway - this is just adding the risk that I default.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You may promise me that I will make 5.26% (assuming you will honor the bond, and not default on your word) but what grantee do I have that the value of bitcoin itself will not fluctuate? 

In the normal currency market, I can buy futures and grantee the exchange rate in the future, assuming again that I trust banks that sell me the contracts will not foreclose, but bitcoin seems riskier, and therefore I am not sure that %5.26 is worth the risk (though anyone that does buy the bonds think it does)]]></description>
