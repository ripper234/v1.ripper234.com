		<description><![CDATA[Nice link, though I doubt this is really the problem. For most off-country queries there aren&#039;t really any search results, like עםםעךק צשפד, so any &quot;did you mean&quot; here is better than nothing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve seen several web sites, trying to produce a service from this type of errors. &lt;br/&gt;Then I thought, why Google is not doing it by themselves. its being done by the google toolbar, but not in the search engine. When i type in Google search engine: &quot;עםםעךק צשפד&quot; (which is &quot;Google maps&quot;) it should return organically in the search results something like: &quot;did you mean Google Maps&quot;. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My guess is that Google are a bit worried about messing with search results. When they launched the &quot;did you mean&quot; service they had &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-05-24-n36.html&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;some problems&lt;/a&gt;, and they got some back fire about it. &lt;br/&gt;I can only assume that since the language typos are a small fraction from the entire searches, Google is OK with leaving these kind of services to small fishes.]]></description>
