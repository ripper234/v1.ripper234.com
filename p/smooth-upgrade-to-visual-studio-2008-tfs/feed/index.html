		<description><![CDATA[Actually it was just Oren who upgraded the server. Turns out my help wasn&#039;t needed, and the process was smooth indeed.

As for VS2008... I tend to disagree. The only visible advantage is that it starts out faster, and loads the solution faster. These are significant benefits but certainly not worth the price of an upgrade. Build times are still abysmal (yes, we have a large solution; yes, we have lots of post-build steps. Every time I hit ctrl+shift+B it still takes nearly half a minute, even for a minor, localized change.) The IDE does not feel any snappier than 2005, and still takes forever to page-in when I switch back to it after a few minutes. I guess the real upgrade-worthy features are C# 3.0 (which we don&#039;t use, yet) and improved JavaScript support, but I couldn&#039;t find any significant improvement beyond those.]]></description>
