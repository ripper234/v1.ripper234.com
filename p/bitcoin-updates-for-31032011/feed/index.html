		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not familiar with the specifics of mail orders, so it might be possible or not. One method that I saw proposed is using geo-caching. The seller stashes the drugs at a random desreted location, notes the GPS coordinates, and sends them to the buyer, who later goes to pick them up, without any direct contact between seller and buyer.

There&#039;s a lot of idealogy involved in some of the bitcoin threads, it might be some of the reasons that led to it&#039;s creation. Still, it&#039;s just a tool, and there are plenty of not-ideological (or not radical) people involved with bitcoin.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Does not sound reasonable. Packages are usually traceable, and if the mail service does open them, they will easily reach the source of the drugs - i.e. the store gets busted.
Even if the &quot;send to two random people&quot; thing is done, the police can find that you were receiving drugs, and follow you in the future, should you decide to order more.

I am not convinced. 
On the other hand, I don&#039;t really know how the drug business works, maybe it is as easy to catch somebody dealing drugs in person.

I read some of the thread. These guys are real anarchists. Amusing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Anna - see this thread for a detailed discussion.
https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=175.0

The mail service cannot check the contents of each package. Since shopping with BTC is much cheaper, because there is no middleman, a drug dealer can afford two copies of each package - one to the recipient, and one to a random address. This way, the mere act of receiving drugs will not implicate you. Let&#039;s assume the mail busts 5% of the packages. For these cases, the customer (who doesn&#039;t receive the package) complains to the drug store, who will issue a refund (another 5% cut in efficiency - still a hell of a lot more efficient than existing distribution methods).]]></description>
