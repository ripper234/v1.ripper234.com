		<description><![CDATA[@Moshe - avoiding specs is preferable when possible, just like avoiding comments in code. However, for medium-large features that are done in one bulk, I think that writing a spec actually saves time. Not every feature can be partitioned to super small pieces. It should, however, not be a huge monolithic document that takes days to create.

@yaron - A PM is the owner of the product direction, and he is responsible for formulating and prioritizing the features, and maintaining the higher level Product Vision. However, I believe that much of the PM&#039;s work should indeed be delegated to feature owners, with the PM remaining as the professional authority and guidance. Asking the PM to define every nitty-gritty detail is very demanding, and doesn&#039;t necessarily have positive ROI. Of course, a PM should be &quot;big enough&quot; and willing to pass some of the control to the feature owners for this model to work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hmmm, then what does the PM do?
Actualy, writing the spec helps the PM understand the requirements.

I think it might be better if the feature owner writes the &#039;test cases&#039; for the spec.
This way you get to see if he indeeds understands the requirements, and you get tests.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ron,

Gig indeed talked about it, but his phrase was something like &quot;I hate specs and try to avoid them&quot;. Gig prefers that every engineer will be a product manager and write his own PRD.
I like Gig opinion and I believe that specs should include only API when needed, otherwise they turn old once you finished writing them... 

It was a great event and probably I will contribute a post regarding it in the next few days,

Keep Performing,
Moshe Kaplan]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wrote a really long reply but it got lost in a crappy error message. In short: it&#039;s a good idea in non-user-facing features (e.g. &quot;provide good product recommendations that would make the user buy more products that suit her taste&quot;) but is very hard and dangerous in user facing features, since the process of going from business goals to spec requires a lot of skills not normally held by (all) developers, e.g. &quot;thinking like a user&quot;, UX, understanding the use case and translating it into a streamlined flow, copy writing, &quot;product attitude&quot; etc. These are skills product managers should hone and developers are frequently blissfully unaware of. That being said, it&#039;s important to involve developers in this process so that those of them who show an interest in it can be grown to be product managers.]]></description>
