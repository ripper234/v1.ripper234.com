		<description><![CDATA[When you guys are done condescending over us poor folk over at Delver, you might want to notice there&#039;s nothing git-specific about this scenario and you can do exactly the same with SVN or any other SCM that supports branching out of arbitrary commits and merging. Git definitely rules, but here it just makes things slightly smoother, not qualitatively different.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s how I&#039;ve been doing this for year :)

the best part - gitk --all   this is the most useful tool in the history of SCM

I miss this stuff really badly when I work with other SCMs.

And shame on me for not getting Delver on git when I had the chance.]]></description>
