		<description><![CDATA[Yaron: I agree about simple tests (preferably a test method per single behavior of a single method in the class being tested) - although it can be frustrating having to refactor your unit tests along with your code, usually I think you need to write tests / make the tests pass after a refactoring anyway, so the price isn&#039;t so big.
imho integration tests don&#039;t help you refactor as well, they are more suitable for when you already have a feature working and wanna make sure it&#039;s according to spec and that it stays ok. you can also make them more configurable so your clients can add cases without coding and recompiling (see fitness etc)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The easy tests I actually do the &quot;test-first&quot; way - write them before the code.

I sometimes do it also for more &quot;complex&quot; tests - but we have to be careful here: In my current project many features are agile in their nature and changes in api (or even functionality) are not rare. Maintaining tests for &quot;agile&quot; features can be very frustrating, especially when I need to explain my peers why tweaking a simple method functionality takes more than a second...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We don&#039;t usually use code coverage tools. I personally try to write tests for the meaningful/complex features, and the tests that are easy to write. You probably don&#039;t want to write tests that are both difficult to write and maintain and are sure to pass - but it&#039;s not always easy to spot them in advance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Also, how do you know your code is well tested? Do you just think/write all the tests you want to write that test every feature of your code? Do you rely on code coverage?]]></description>
