		<description><![CDATA[@Chokladkakan: Thanks, glad to see it get used.

FYI, &quot;my server&quot; is not really my server - WhateverOrigin is hosted at Heroku, using their free plan - so you&#039;re certainly not causing me any issues by using it. Still, if you want to have more control and host your own copy, just create a Heroku account and deploy it there.

&lt;a href=&#039;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/play&#039; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; can get you started, ping me if you have more questions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello ripper234,

First, let it be known that I adore WhateverOrigin.org - I am using it for a rather specialised plugin for a forum I frequent. It&#039;s great! Further, let it be known that I have no sort of knowledge of server applications, which leads me to my question:

How would I deploy WhateverOrigin on my own server? Since I have access to one I would prefer not bothering your server with my traffic. I tried simply putting the source from github on the server, but that wasn&#039;t enough. 

Thanks for any help.]]></description>
