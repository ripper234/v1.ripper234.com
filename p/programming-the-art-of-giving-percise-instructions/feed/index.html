		<description><![CDATA[This is not the most efficient way, because you don&#039;t need to calculate (X+Y)! at all. Note that the biggest number  will be at most (2X)!/(X!)^{2}, (by setting X=Y). So there is no need to calculate the number (X+Y)! to its bitter end. Probably the most efficient way to calculate this asymptotically, is by using Stirling&#039;s formula. Note that by the nature of this approximation, it is evident that the complexity is way beyond exponential. It is in fact something like X^{X}.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re not alone in this confusion. There is one route from the origin to itself - the empty route.

It&#039;s basically a matter of definition, but my definition allows us to have no special cases in the 3rd solution.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Eli.

Boaz, you are incorrect. If x == 0, this means you have no more Left moves left. You have only one route to get to the origin, by going Down all the time. Remember, we are calculating the number of routes to get to the origin, not the length of the route.]]></description>

if (y == 0) return x;]]></description>
