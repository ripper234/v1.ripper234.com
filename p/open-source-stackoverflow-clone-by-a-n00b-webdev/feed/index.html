		<description><![CDATA[Hello,
Nice article, I have tried to do exactly the same thing few months ago with a goal to build some kind of open source stack over flow, which support multiple languages ( since I want to build one for developers in my country). I got to the point of implementing comments, points and badges ( used mysql and hibernate for my data access as well), then the project start to gather dust until now. I always looks for some one to work with on the project, and will be happy to join in if you want more development on this.
THanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Ron: super-cool. 
as for &quot;code review&quot;, looking at the UserAwareController, I&#039;d have made &lt;code&gt;protected User CurrentUser&lt;/code&gt; a method (&lt;code&gt;GetCurrentUser()&lt;/code&gt;) as this is not a Property of the controller, and also to denote that we might go out of process to get it

@Tomer: Filters in MS MVC is also new to me. Good to see that they progress nicely

@Eli: Calling something else from what you like &quot;the Borg&quot; is ... borg-ish. I believe in options, and the new MVC stack (along with the older MonoRail and newer FubuMVC) are very good options if you want to kee in C# land, as Py/DJango is great if you like the Python ecosystem
options and choices, that&#039;s the thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Tomer - I wasn&#039;t aware of the existence of filters. I&#039;ll have to try it out, it might be indeed an easier solution.

@Eli - I am quite comfortable with most of the .Net ecosystem, and part of the purpose of this exercise was to deepen my understanding of some parts of it that were in the dark until now. Learning other languages is good, but deeper knowledge of one&#039;s &quot;chosen tool of the trade&quot; is essential.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice post, Ron, well done.

It&#039;s a shame you didn&#039;t use the opportunity to practice a decent language &#038; web-app stack like Python/Django, instead of keeping with the Borg :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First off, wicked cool - I never did get off my ass and learn web development, and it&#039;s a definite hindrance.
Re UserAwareController, isn&#039;t it easier to implement the user authentication logic as a filter which pre-handles authentication and places the user token in the request context?]]></description>
