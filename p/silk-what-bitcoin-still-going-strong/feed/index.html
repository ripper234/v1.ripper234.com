		<description><![CDATA[I think even more significant is to look at the graph, at what you referred to as the October 2nd &quot;big panic&quot;.  Yes, the price temporarily dropped, but the panics are becoming smaller and the recoveries are becoming faster, as bitcoin goes through this &quot;price discovery&quot; phase.  

The price got ahead of its &quot;true value&quot; earlier this year, as people rushed into Bitcoins, bidding the price up, and paying a premium.  Now, as bitcoin&#039;s true value becomes greater, as more merchants accept it, as more tools become available, and as it becomes more inevitable that Bitcoin will be around for a while, the current premium over the &quot;true value&quot; becomes less and less.  The drops on negative news are smaller and the bounce-back is swifter.]]></description>
