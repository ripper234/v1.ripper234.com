		<description><![CDATA[I guess I am type 2 person. I never have enough motivation to do anything, at least for myself...
Keeping my inbox with low amount of e-mails helps a little, in wasting the nano amounts of motivation I have for useful stuff, but sometimes I just find myself forwarding something again and again to FUT.
I envy people who can actually do stuff and all, they are really awesome in my eyes. :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tali - just read the documentation, you can use many different syntaxes.
Also Sanebox can add all the various shortcuts to your auto-complete address book.

With FollowUpThen there&#039;s no need to sign up before using it. I think SaneBox might require signup (it&#039;s a paid service).]]></description>
