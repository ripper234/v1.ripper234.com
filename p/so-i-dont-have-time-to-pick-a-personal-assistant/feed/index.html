		<description><![CDATA[I am happy to announce I have hired a temporary personal assistant (a more fitting term is Executive Assistant actually) for this role.

Unless your almost no CV/screening candidate will also handle your actual tasks (for which you seek the PA to begin with), this is pure HR/recruiting issue. The set of skills, experience and abilities are not necessarily the same. Either you call for a temporary recruiter position or you source it to an HR agency.]]></description>

Probably the job market really sucks for personal assistants these days (or you&#039;re willing to pay a lot of $$$).]]></description>
