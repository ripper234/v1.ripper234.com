		<description><![CDATA[I wish I had your luck, I can still see the SearchWiki horror in every search... (you should be signed-in to see this)

By the way, Marissa Mayer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/10/google-search-wiki-to-soon-include-an-off-button-thank-you-marissa/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; that Google Search Wiki would soon have a toggle button that allow people to turn it off (“early Q1.”) – I can’t wait… and regarding your Expert Exchange wish, Marissa said: 
&lt;i&gt;&quot;For now that data is not being used to change overall search results, she said. &lt;b&gt;But in the future it’s likely Google will use the data to at least make obvious changes. An example is if “thousands of people” were to knock a search result off a search page, they’d be likely to make a change&lt;/b&gt;&quot;&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>
