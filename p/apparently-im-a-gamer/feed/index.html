		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know what&#039;s ivory sale...

What do you do? You threaten to leave, of course. It&#039;s preposterous that in order to fix technical difficulties they have in providing you with a basic service, they want more money.

I argued with them, and got them to offer me some sort of deal. It involved me committing to another year, but the overall price was lower than I originally paid.

The problem is the gamer account is not available on MPLS (without an installed dialer), like I wanted. For now I&#039;ve switched over to another ISP, but it&#039;s still giving me problems.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ron.
I&#039;ve tried doing what you&#039;ve suggested.
They insist I will pay for a gamer service (60+ NIS per month).
I&#039;m now connected for free using ivory sale...

What should I do?
