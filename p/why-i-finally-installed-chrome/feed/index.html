		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s really keeping me in Firefox land, as I don&#039;t use AdBlock. I do use IETab and WeatherFox, I wonder how easy it would be for Google guys to adapt FF&#039;s extension system so Chrome could run FF extension.

What I like about Chrome in my 3 minute test drive is the View Source - I can&#039;t pinpoint it (especially now that I&#039;m home on a Chrome-less computer), but the screen looked better somehow, not to mention to ability to actually have URLs to View Source. It&#039;s more streamlined (opens up in the same tabs as normal windows).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Welcome to the fold. :-)

There are only two Firefox features (well, one feature and an extension) that I miss in Chrome: Adblock Plus and full-page zoom. I guess it&#039;s only a question of time; Chrome is what, less than three months old?...]]></description>
