		<description><![CDATA[Interesting, thanks for the link.

I believe the direction the world is heading is such that everyone will accept everything they do to be recorded, and eventually such laws will become irrelevant, unenforceable and be changed to fit the times.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s this exact undefined &quot;creepiness factor&quot; which made me choose to stop recording, and to post this in the first place. I think that if you choose to record all phone calls, the very least is you can let your friends know about it.

But we all need to prepare for the future - such recordings will be everywhere, not just audio but video as well ... perhaps someday our thought patterns also.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that although it may be good to record calls of 3rd parties, recording regular phone calls can be a little...well, crippy. I believe that sometimes, recording calls can be nice, for listening to them years later, like photographs in a photobook, but sometimes people can use such things against you. I have mixed feelings about the idea, and I don;t really know what to say for or against this...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Ariel, @ripper234, I believe that when call recording, or even ambient passive recording is combined with speech recognition and textual indexing and search capabilities, it does bring us one step closer to an extension of our memories. We have all the technology to build it today. Is anyone aware of such a solution?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Ariel - hmm, so you&#039;re making me think I&#039;m not the crazy one for wanting to record everything. Now I actually wonder how many of my friends have been recording our calls in the last few years and just haven&#039;t said anything about it :)

Have you actually found this useful? How often? Can you give a few examples?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[From my understanding, you may record any conversation as long as at least one participant is aware and willing, so if that participant is you, you&#039;re cool. At least in Israel.

I record all the calls on my phone. Every once in a while I copy them off my phone and encrypt them just to make sure phone calls don&#039;t get out of hand. It&#039;s simply too useful.

Besides, I&#039;m not deluding myself that my communications are untampered, so I might as well have a copy myself. Anyone having a problem with that has a problem inherent with technology.]]></description>
