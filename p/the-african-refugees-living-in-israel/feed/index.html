		<description><![CDATA[@Eli - true enough. I&#039;m hoping that the cost of getting into the country will be increased so much that it won&#039;t be worth it.

In any case, if you take one thing from this post, is that saying &quot;just deport them all&quot; is not a valid solution either, regardless all game theoretical calculations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As you know I&#039;m also a &quot;hippie leftist&quot; and all for human rights, but there&#039;s a difficult &quot;game theory&quot; challenge here. Warmly accepting the refugees into our society will very much encourage other refugees to flock here in hordes. And as history teaches us, no borders and police can stop determined refugees seeking better life. USA has about half a million (by some counts) of illegal refugees coming in yearly, despite the billions pored into stopping it from happening.

I&#039;m not proposing a solution here, just noting that this is a hard problem with many aspects to consider.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Lior - the justification is about helping people that need our help. Also, as someone put it &quot;they are going to eat one way or the other ... let&#039;s help them do it the right way&quot;. We can start by just allowing them to work legally. I won&#039;t go into budget discussions here, god knows the budget has loads of fat to trim.

@Asaf - the big fear is that letting these people stay will encourage others. If we have proper borders, like we should have had years ago, then, this fear is largely irrelevant because &quot;just getting into Israel&quot; won&#039;t be feasible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You say &quot;refugees&quot;, but a large part of those infiltrating Israel illegally cannot be considered refugees by any accepted definition.

For example, this is what the Wikipedia article on refugees states: &quot;A refugee is a person who is outside their country of origin or habitual residence because they have suffered persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or because they are a member of a persecuted &#039;social group&#039;. Such a person may be referred to as an &#039;asylum seeker&#039; until recognized by the state where she makes her claim.&quot; Even if you extend this definition to include those who have lost their shelter and livelihood to natural disaster, it still leaves out many of the aforementioned infiltrates.

I&#039;m all for giving appropriate shelter to refugees, but for all others, implementing a &quot;just manage to get in and you are home free&quot; policy simply does not make sense.]]></description>
