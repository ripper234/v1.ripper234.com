		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, this comment is for another post - http://ripper234.com/p/how-to-setup-a-free-mediawiki-on-heroku/, but it is not possible to comment there...

First of all, thanks for the tutorial!
Have you tried/managed to use Short URLs (https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Short_URL) with your Heroku-based wiki? Here is the doc how to change Apache settings - https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-php-settings, but it is not quite clear for me what do to. Would appreciate your help (or another post with instructions ;).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[P.S - about the weed...

I believe weed may no longer be good for me.
I mean: I think it was good that I did it. It opened up my mind for me and let me being this process of healing I&#039;m going through right now.
Yes, healing.

A friend told me that Bipolar episodes are often just a side effect of &quot;waking up&quot;. Of dealing with all the shit we piled on our soul during our lives.
It&#039;s an indicator of Great Change.

I think the change I&#039;m going through in the last few years is great for me.
It&#039;s scary sometimes, and difficult. But it&#039;s good.

I also think, that weed may no longer serve me. It&#039;s possible I&#039;ll never smoke another joint in my life.
Well, &quot;my life&quot; is a long period of time. Anything can happen.
But for the foreseeable future, I think weed may be dangerous to me. It triggers stuff.
I&#039;m already triggered enough as it is right now. I don&#039;t need substances.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t read the update you posted on it, i probably will though. I am familiar though with the question you linked to on quora, and many similar to it.
Good luck with the treatment, and I truly hope you find success (whatever that may mean to you).

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your candor and openness Gilly :)

I am already seeing both a psychologist and a psychiatrist, as well as other self-awareness processes I&#039;m going through (The Sangha being a key part of that).

My psychiatrist said a few months ago that he can&#039;t diagnose me because I was smoking weed about once a month.
As a result, I stopped smoking weed completely for 6 months, and am following up with my psychiatrist to get a better diagnosis.

Luckily, I don&#039;t think I actually have manic episodes, but more like hypomania.

Thanks again for caring and speaking up!

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Ron,
You don&#039;t know who i am, but I have heard quite a lot about you having worked at similar workplaces in the past, but at different times (delver a.k.a. sears). I also follow your blog for quite some time. You sound like a really talented and smart guy. I really like your candor and openness, especially around personal subjects like polyamory.
But DUDE!! please see a shrink, preferably a psychiatrist! I don&#039;t mean to be mean at all and I really hope this doesn&#039;t offend you (I have issues as well, just like the rest of us), on the contrary - I&#039;m writing this because I&#039;m worried. I&#039;m a Psychology student almost done with my bachelors degree (while working full time at a startup) so i&#039;m not close to being an expert, but I can say that your recent blog posts indeed sound like the textbook definition of bipolar syndrome. The high&#039;s, lo&#039;s and the &#039;Satori&#039; you&#039;re describing all sound exactly like depressing and manic phases are for people suffering from bipolar syndrome.
Just a worried soul, Gilly.]]></description>
